Supply an absolute original artifact path, arm64/x86_64 entry address, explicit file-offset code mappings, initial canonical registers, fully initialized memory and selected memory observations. Returns effective initial/final registers including SIMD bit patterns, selected memory changes, instruction-entry coverage and an explicit stop reason. Stops before external calls or the outer return and at missing/protected memory, unsupported runtime instructions and instruction/time/coverage limits. No automatic loader, relocation, ABI stack, runtime, TLS, imported-call stubs or argument inference; unspecified registers are modeled as zero with effective values recorded. Evidence is derived conditional replay and preserves artifact/engine hashes and assumptions, not observed app behavior. Initial macOS/Linux profile requires caller-supplied REA_UNICORN_PYTHON with Unicorn 2.1.2 and Capstone 5.0.6; no installation is performed.",
